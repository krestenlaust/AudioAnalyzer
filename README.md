# AudioAnalyzer
View and edit audio files in both frequency- and volume-domain. The project both includes the user-interface and a custom implementation of the Cooley-Tukey written in F#.

## Background
This project was originally developed as the primary focus of my school project [krestenlaust/Fourier-transformation](https://github.com/krestenlaust/Fourier-transformation). When the project ended, I split the original repository into two separate repositories (the other being [krestenlaust/Aud.IO](https://github.com/krestenlaust/Aud.IO)), preserving the commit history. The aftermath of the transformation, is that some of the original commits has nonsensical descriptions, in the context of this repository. Feel free to ignore them.

Because the project originally was an assignment, I've created a report to go alongside it. You can find the report in the original repository (Fourier-transformation).

## Usage
Needs description on how to use the program (with screenshots).

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute however you like, any input/issue is welcome. If I don't respond at first, try tagging me as well.
